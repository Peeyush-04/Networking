# Networking Project using Cisco Packet Tracer

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a basic network topology implemented in Cisco Packet Tracer, focusing on IP addressing, static routing, and interconnectivity between five buildings using switches, hubs, and routers.

## Features
- **IP Addressing:** Implemented a structured IP addressing scheme for efficient network management.
- **Use of Network Devices:** Configured routers, switches, and hubs to establish connectivity.
- **Static Routing:** Implemented static routes to enable communication between different network segments.
- **Inter-Building Connectivity:** Designed a network that connects five buildings seamlessly.

## Network Components Used
- **Routers:** Configured with static routing for inter-network communication.
- **Switches:** Used to connect multiple devices within a building.
- **Hubs:** Implemented where necessary to extend network connectivity.
- **End Devices:** PCs and other devices assigned specific IP addresses.
- **Cabling:** Proper Ethernet connections between devices.

## Implementation Details
1. **Topology Design:** Created a structured layout in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. **IP Addressing Scheme:** Allocated unique subnets to different buildings.
3. **Router Configuration:** Implemented static routes to facilitate communication.
4. **Switch and Hub Usage:** Deployed appropriate network devices to optimize traffic flow.
5. **Testing & Troubleshooting:** Verified device connectivity and routing functionality.

## Setup Instructions
1. Install Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Peeyush-04/Networking.git
   ```
3. Open the `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
4. Analyze and modify configurations as needed.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration of dynamic routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, etc.).
- Addition of VLANs for improved network segmentation.
- Implementation of DHCP for automatic IP assignment.
- Security enhancements such as Access Control Lists (ACLs).
